User requested a habit tracker web app with custom routine creation, task timers, skip/reset controls, and text-to-speech alerts. UI built with PicoCSS. Tasks are grouped into routines stored locally. User experienced a bug where task name/timer wasnâ€™t showing after loading into a routine. Updated app includes fallback values and cleaned layout. Email subscription was removed. User wants to export to Replit for further debugging.
